                        <h2>Curiosity + Perseverance + Passion = VITALITY</h2>
                    <p>My journey into data science began not in a classroom, but in my previous full-time role, where working with data migration deliverables sparked my curiosity about the potential of AI to turn complex data challenges into actionable solutions. This curiosity carried me from analyzing energy sector data objects to building AI-driven passion projects, and ultimately led me to enroll in the M.S. in Data Science program at Columbia University. <br> <br>
                        The word that best captures my character is 'vitality,' representing a plant or person’s resilience, growth, and the ability to flourish under pressure. When I committed to transitioning into data science, I turned my weekends into productive learning sessions, mastering online courses, building challenging projects, and crafting application materials that would open doors to my future. Arriving in New York marked the beginning of an accelerated journey where I embraced every opportunity to sharpen my skills. In my first semester, I achieved a 4.08 GPA while earning recognition at hackathons, as well as developing full-stack applications that eventually secured me a paid position in the Columbia DSI Scholar Program. During the winter break, I channeled my interest for data science and mental well-being into MorningTide, a commercial-grade MVP that my partner and I continue to advance through the Columbia Startup Lab. <br> <br>
                        I believe that excellence requires an alignment of mind, body, and soul. To this end, I nourish my mind through literature classics from Gabriel García Márquez to Gu Long, whose captivating narratives help me recharge after countless productive days. I maintain physical vitality through fitness and bodybuilding, understanding that physical strength translates to mental resilience that ensures I bring my complete, energized self to every professional challenge. Cold plunges and mindful meditation center my spirit, cultivating the focus essential for high-pressure environments. This holistic approach forms my vitality: the steam that powers my dream. <br> <br>
                        Today, I stand at the intersection of curiosity and technological innovations, leveraging ML/DL frameworks to transform data into meaningful insights. Whether building predictive models, designing scalable architectures, or collaborating with diverse teams, I approach each challenge with the same vitality that brought me here. As I continue to grow in this dynamic field, my mission remains clear: to harness the power of data science and AI to create solutions that not only solve complex problems but also contribute to a more innovative and impactful future.
